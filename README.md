Welcome!

This project was a test for me to see how much of what I've learned in my self study I could implement in a project. I was suprised to learn how much of what I've learned has stayed in my head however there were times I looked to Stack Overflow for help.

I also utilised ChatGPT to assist with the 'Budget Per Day' feature as I needed to know the remaining days of the month etc. I have learned so much from this project and I can't wait to learn more in my own time on my journey to breaking into Software Development!
